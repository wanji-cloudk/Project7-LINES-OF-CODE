This is a solid script for a command-line utility that count functional lines in Python files.

## To run test on line.py,and to ensure that the application functions as intended execute the following command:
```bash
lines.py

## Run your program with python lines.py. Your program should exit with sys.exit and provide an error message:
Too few command-line arguments

## Create two python programs, hello.py and goodbye.py. Run python lines.py hello.py goodbye.py. Your program should exit with sys.exit and provide an error message:
Too many command-line arguments

##Create a text file called invalid_extension.txt. Run your program with python lines.py invalid_extension.txt. Your program should exit with sys.exit and provide an error message:
Not a Python file

##Run your program with python lines.py non_existent_file.py. Assuming non_existent_file.py doesn’t exist, your program should exit with sys.exit and provide an error message:
File does not exist
